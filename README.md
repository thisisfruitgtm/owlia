## üîê Security

- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (12 rounds)
- JWT sessions with NextAuth.js v5
- Role-based access control (AuthGuard in layout)
- Server-side session validation
- SQL injection prevention (Prisma)
- XSS protection (Next.js auto-escape)
- CSRF tokens (NextAuth)
- Input validation with Zod

## üêõ Known Issues & Solutions

### NextAuth v5 (Beta) + Edge Runtime
**Issue:** Middleware with Prisma doesn't work in Edge Runtime.  
**Solution:** Use `AuthGuard` component in layout for server-side auth checks instead of middleware.

### Session Cookie After Login
**Issue:** Redirect too fast after login, before cookie is set.  
**Solution:** 1 second delay before redirect to allow cookie propagation.
