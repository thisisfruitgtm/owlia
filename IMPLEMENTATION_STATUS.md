## ðŸš§ Remaining Tasks

### 1. Guide Page Conversion ðŸ”„
**Status:** Not started (large task)
**File to create:** `app/ghid/page.tsx`

**What's needed:**
- Convert `ghid-buget-marketing-startup-nation.html` to Next.js
- Integrate GuideEmailGate (shows initially)
- Integrate GuideTracker (after unlock)
- Add `data-section-id` to each section for tracking
- Sections to track: intro, industries, calculator, mistakes, eligibility, allocation, checklist

**Approach:**
```tsx
"use client";
import { useState } from "react";
import GuideEmailGate from "@/components/GuideEmailGate";
import GuideTracker from "@/components/GuideTracker";

export default function GuidePage() {
  const [guideAccessId, setGuideAccessId] = useState<string | null>(null);
  
  const sections = ['intro', 'industries', 'calculator', 'mistakes', 'eligibility', 'allocation', 'checklist'];
  
  return (
    <>
      {!guideAccessId && (
        <GuideEmailGate onUnlock={(id) => setGuideAccessId(id)} />
      )}
      
      {guideAccessId && (
        <GuideTracker guideAccessId={guideAccessId} sections={sections} />
      )}
      
      <div className="guide-content">
        {/* Convert HTML sections here */}
        <section data-section-id="intro">...</section>
        <section data-section-id="industries">...</section>
        {/* etc. */}
      </div>
    </>
  );
}
```

### 2. Resend Email Integration ðŸ”„
**Status:** Not started
**Files to create:**
- `lib/email/resend.ts` - Resend client setup
- `lib/email/templates/guide-download.tsx` - HTML email template

**What's needed:**
```ts
// lib/email/resend.ts
import { Resend } from 'resend';

const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);

export async function sendGuideEmail(email: string) {
  await resend.emails.send({
    from: 'OWLIA <noreply@owlia.ro>',
    to: email,
    subject: 'Ghidul tÄƒu: Buget Marketing Start-Up Nation',
    html: GuideEmailTemplate,
    attachments: [{
      filename: 'ghid-buget-marketing-startup-nation.pdf',

  });
}
```

**TODO:**
